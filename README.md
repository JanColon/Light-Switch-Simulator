Godot project files for Light Switch Simulator

# A more In-depth Description
I made a redundant game in the Godot engine called 'Light Switch Simulator.' It was my first foray into using Godot and posting a game on itch.io. The game is pretty stupid overall, but I thought to post the project files for it anyway in the event someone starting to use Godot would find some use for it. Feel free to use the code for anything you need.
